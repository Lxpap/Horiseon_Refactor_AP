# Horiseon Refactor Project

## Description 

This repository includes all of the assets and code necessary for updating Horiseon's website to ensure:

1. Accessibility is addressed throughout it
2. A semantics-first approach is followed in the code 
3. The code is optimised and follows a logical structure


## Installation

In order for these changes to be implemented in the live version of Horiseon's website, the existing files will need to be replaced with the provided ones. During this process, all necessary steps to ensure links are correct need to be taken.


## Mock-Up

The updated code does not affect the application visually:
